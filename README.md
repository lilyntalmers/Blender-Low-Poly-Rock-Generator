## Blender (3.0.0) - Low Poly Rock Generator

This is an [addon](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/editors/preferences/addons.html) for [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) 3.0.0 to generate low poly rocks.  

It was [based on an addon](https://github.com/PopThosePringles/blender-low-poly-rock) that unfortunately hasn't been updated, so I decided to ask for help to fix it. And a generous person on BlenderArtist helped me to fix it. So, I'm uploading it in here in case someone needs it future. 

I don't know Python at all, but it gets the job done for me in Blender 3.0.0. Here is the thread: [BlenderArtist Thread](https://blenderartists.org/t/low-poly-rock-generator-script-showing-error-in-blender-3-0-0/1354349)

Option to create a more stylised type of rock by remeshing it.
